# Variable Screening

## Chapter 6 outline
- Parsimony in statistical modelling and model fitting; SLR vs MLR contrasts and common issues (multicollinearity, unexpected signs, non-significant terms).
- Information criteria and selection mechanics: Akaike’s Information Criterion, stepwise regression workflow (forward/backward/combined) with sequential steps.
- Worked illustrations: exploratory plots and pairs plots, pig carcass measurements, concrete strength, and other example regressions with coefficient estimates and confidence intervals.
- Selection cautions and diagnostics: variance inflation factors, checking signs/magnitude, and notes on extrapolation.
- Textbook structure (Chapter 6, Variable Screening Methods): 6.1 Why use a variable screening method?; 6.2 Stepwise regression; 6.3 All-possible-regressions selection procedure; 6.4 Caveats and appropriate use.
