Chapter 1 Revisions
- change to chapter 0 (to emphasise pre-req nature)

- Switch order of alpha and beta sliders on first plot (so alpha first)
- make it so a negative beta reads as 'E[Y]= a - bX' rather than 'E[Y]= a + -bX' in the plot. 


Excersise 1 has the solution included 
- ask to use the existing variables assigned
- maintain little x in r names


Sec 1.3 add proper cross ref
 - add proper definition of epsilon
 - remove subsections
 - 1.3.2 mu latex
 - add ‘terminology’ block for homoscedasticity

1.5 flesh out the linear model function
Use the ‘salary example parameters to generate data

 Note that x is not treated as an RV (just here for example)
 
 - make linear models section chapter 0.
 - add glossary term for estimation/estimate 
 - use s for sigma
 - clarify yhat as predicted value
 - 
 - ‘asjust’ 
 - 2.2.2 has no title
 - make sure all points visible
 - merge 2.2.5/2.2.6
 - remove ‘colour’ legend label from ggplot
 - 2.28 make sure consistent naming for s^2 (remove old sigma hat naming)
 - add ‘continue after RSE
 - 
 - 2.2.9 add visualisation for r, and R^2
 - exercise 2.5 too difficult
 - 
 - add ‘continue’ before 2.3.1
 - need to add exercise 2.6
 - 
 - make reference to chapter on residual diagnostics in sec 2.3.1.1
 - make visualisation of changing reducing SE(b) effect on p-value
 - and on CI? (Need some visualisation here)
 - need RCode for CIs  
 - make hierarchical glossary? (E.g. for different CIs?)
 - emphasise sources of uncertainty for intervals (i.e. a and b for CI, a,b and e for PI)
 - need conclusion/ lead into next section
 - 

MLR
- continue between eg3.2 and ex3.1 not working? 
- 3.3.1 expand ‘note on r formulas 
- fix coef(mod)
- revise ex3.2
- finish key point on interpreting t-tests
- formatting on 3.3.3 heading [multicollinearity] 
- icons for call-outs?
- remove ‘glance’ section, add ‘summary()’ section (that includes short r^2 discussion). I.e. 3.5 pulling it together with `summary()1st
- change example from advertising to dataset with categorical predictors (save switching mid chapter) e.g. mtcars the whole way?
