# Introduction to linear models {#sec-introduction-to-linear-models}

## Statistical models {#sec-statistical-models}

A central aim of statistical modelling is to understand how one *variable* changes in relation to others. In your own work, these variables will have concrete meaning - perhaps plant growth, reaction time, exam score, or income - but for now we will simply call them $x$ and $Y$.

In regression, we choose one variable $Y$ to treat as the **[outcome]{.glossary term="Response (outcome) variable"}** we want to explain or predict, and $x$ as one or more **[predictors]{.glossary term="Predictor (explanatory) variable"}**. Our goal is to describe how changes in $x$ are associated with changes in $Y$.

A simple way to express this idea is

$$Y = f(x)$$

meaning that the value of $Y$ can be described by some function of $x$. If we knew this function exactly, and if the world behaved perfectly, then knowing $x$ would tell us everything about $Y$. Many physical laws look like this—for example, $E = mc^2$—but real data rarely follow a perfectly deterministic relationship.

In practice, even when $x$ is held constant, repeated observations of $Y$ will vary. People respond differently, instruments fluctuate, biological systems are noisy, and experimental conditions change. To recognise this, [statistical models]{.glossary term="Statistical model"} include a **[random error term]{.glossary}**:

$$Y = f(x) + \varepsilon$$.

Here, $\varepsilon$ represents natural variability: the part of $Y$ that our model does not or cannot explain. 

## Linear prediction {#sec-linear-prediction}

To make our model concrete, we need to choose a form for the function $f(x)$. A natural starting point—because it is simple, interpretable, and surprisingly powerful—is a **linear function**:

$$ f(x) = \alpha + \beta x $$.

This allows us to describe the **expected value** of $Y$ as

$$ E[Y] = \alpha + \beta x $$

This is the familiar straight-line relationship:  
- $\alpha$ is the [intercept]{.glossary}, the point where the line meets the vertical axis, and  
- $\beta$ is the [slope]{.glossary}, describing how we expect $Y$ to change when $x$ increases by one unit.

```

```

::: Assumption
Y and x have a linear relationship

::: Example

### Salary growth over time {#sec-salary-growth-over-time}

Suppose you have received a job offer from *Company A*, and you want to predict your salary after working there for 10 years. You are told that the **average starting salary** at this company is $50,000, and that salaries **increase by $5,000 per year** of employment.

We can represent this relationship using a simple [linear predictor]{.glossary}. For an employee with $x$ years at the company, the expected salary is

$$
E[Y] = 50{,}000 + 5{,}000 \cdot x.
$$

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Plot {#sec-salary-growth-over-time-plot}

```{r module00-lm-salary-growth-over-time-plot}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Expected salary at Company A as a function of years employed."
ggplot() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 5e4, slope = 5e3, colour = '#2196F3') +
  lims(x = c(0, 15), y = c(4e4, 13e4)) +
  labs(x = "Years Employed", y = "Expected Salary ($)")
```

## Code {#sec-salary-growth-over-time-code}

```{r module00-lm-salary-growth-over-time-code}
#| eval: false

  geom_abline(intercept = 5e4, slope = 5e3, colour = '#2196F3') +
  lims(x = c(0, 15), y = c(4e4, 13e4)) +
  labs(x = "Years Employed", y = "Expected Salary ($)")
```

:::

After 10 years of employment ($x = 10$), our linear predictor gives

$$
E[Y] = 50{,}000 + 5{,}000 \times 10 = 100{,}000.
$$
:::

::: Exercise

### A competing offer {#sec-a-competing-offer}

A second company also offers you a position. Their **starting salary** is higher—$70,000 on average—but their yearly pay increases are smaller. Employees who have been at the company for 6 years earn, on average, **$18,000 more** than when they started.

We model expected salary after $x$ years as:

$$
E[Y] = \alpha + \beta x.
$$

::::{}

#### Choosing parameters {#sec-choosing-parameters}

* The starting salary gives $\alpha = 70{,}000$.
* The 6-year increase gives $6\beta = 18{,}000$, so $\beta = 3{,}000$.

Assign these values in R:

#### Linear prediction {#sec-linear-prediction-2}

Thus the linear predictor for Company B is

$$
E[Y] = 70{,}000 + 3{,}000 \cdot x.

Below is a plot comparing salary trends for both companies:

:::

Now compute the expected salary after 10 years:

#| exercise: ex_1.1.2
#| envir: Ex1
E_Y <- _____ + (_____ * _____)

#### Using R functions {#sec-using-r-functions}

Evaluating the expression in R:

```{webr module00-lm-using-r-functions}
#| exercise: ex_1.1.2.2
#| envir: Ex1
#| edit: false
E_Y
```

This matches the calculation:

$$
E[Y] = 70{,}000 + 3{,}000 \times 10 = 100{,}000.
$$

Now we can turn this into a reusable function:

```{webr module00-lm-using-r-functions-2}
#| edit: false
simple_linear_prediction <- function(X, alpha = 7e4, beta = 4e3) {
  alpha + (beta * X)

```

Predict salaries for these employment durations:

### Good work! {#sec-good-work .unnumbered}

Next we will extend our linear predictor to form a full linear *statistical* model.
:::

-  [ ] Continue

## Random Errors {#sec-random-errors}

-   In practice, data rarely fall perfectly on a straight line. Even if the underlying relationship between $x$ and $Y$ is approximately linear, individual observations tend to vary around that line.

-   As mentioned in Section 1.x, to account for this variation we add an *error term*, $\varepsilon$, to our model

$$
Y=\alpha + \beta x + \varepsilon
$$

### Mean Zero {#sec-mean-zero}

-   The error term represents the \*difference between the actual value of $Y$ and the value predicted by the [linear predictor]{.glossary}, $E[Y]$.
-   On average, we expect these error terms to balance out:

::: Assumption

The mean of the error term is zero ([mean-zero errors]{.glossary}):

$$
E[\varepsilon]=\mu=0
$$

i.e. The linear predictor gives the correct value of $Y$ on average
:::

### Constant variance {#sec-varAssumption}

-   While correct on average, we expect there to be some *spread* of data around the line (this is why we have the error term). The amount of spread is measured by the *variance* of the errors.

-   We assume that this variance is *constant* - like $mu=0$, it is the same for all values of $x$ however we dont specify which particular value it takes:

::: Assumption 
The variance of the error term is constant for all values of x ([homoscedasticity]{.glossary}): $$Var(\varepsilon)=\sigma^2$$
:::

### Normal distribution {#sec-normal-distribution}

While the assumptions of mean 0 and constant variance describe the center and spread of the errors, they don’t fully specify the shape of their distribution. To model this more completely, we often assume that the errors follow a Normal distribution.

::: Assumption
The error is normally distributed ([normal errors]{.glossary}) with mean $\mu=0$ and variance $\sigma^2$. $$\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$$
:::

```{ojs module00-lm-normal-distribution-view}
//| echo: false
//| panel: sidebar
viewof mu = Inputs.range([-5, 5], {
  value: 0,
  step: 0.1,

  value: 1,
  step: 0.1,
  label: 'Standard deviation (σ):'
})

SQRT2PI=Math.sqrt(2 * Math.PI)

normalDensity = (x, mean, sd) =>
  (1 / (sd * SQRT2PI)) * Math.exp(-0.5 * ((x - mean) / sd) ** 2);
  
densityGrid_1 = d3.range((-4 * sigma)+mu, mu+(4 * sigma), sigma / 50).map(x => ({
  x,
  density: normalDensity(x,mu,sigma)
}));

tex.block`\varepsilon \sim \text{Normal}(${mu}, ${sigma}^2)`

```
::: Example
### Variation in salary {#sec-variation-in-salary}

Lets return to our simple linear model of salary at ~company A~,

$$
E[Salary] = 50,000 + 5,000\times Years 
$$ 

This expresses how salary tends to increase with experience (i.e. on averaage). But in practice, not every employee with the same number of years earns the same amount — some earn a bit more, some a bit less. Suppose we know that most employees — about two-thirds of them — earn within roughly \$4,000 of the average salary for their experience level. In other words, if the average salary after five years is \$75,000, then about two-thirds of employees earn between \$71,000 and \$79,000, and almost everyone (about 95%) earns between \$67,000 and \$83,000.

We can capture this variability with a random error term, $\varepsilon$, assumed to follow a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma = 4,000$.

$$
Salary = 50,000 + 5,000\times Years + \varepsilon, \quad{\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,4000^2)}
$$

This means that for a given number of years $x$: - The expected salary is $50,000 + 5,000\cdot x$ - Actual salaries will vary around that average, typically within about ±\$4,000

For example, after 5 years (x=5): 
$$
E[Y]=\$50,000 + \$5,000 \times 5 = \$75,000 
$$

The distribution of salaries for employees with 5 years' experience is

$$
Y\sim \mathcal{N}(75,000, 4,000^2)
$$

Since we have a probability distribution over $Y$, we can use R to evaluate the probability of any given salary after x years at the company.

For example, we want to know if employed at *company A*, what is the probabity after working there for 10 years I will have a salary of at least \$110,000?

First lets calculate the average salary after 10 years

```{r module00-lm-variation-in-salary}
50000+(5000*10)
```

\$100,000.

Now

```{r module00-lm-variation-in-salary-2}
pnorm(11e4,1e5, 4e3, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

The following diagram tells us roughly the probability of observing a $Y$ value in the given range:

```{ojs module00-lm-variation-in-salary-view}

$$
Y=\alpha+\beta x+\varepsilon, \quad{\varepsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)}

## A simple Linear model in R {#sec-a-simple-linear-model-in-r}

-   finish this section and lead into the next on fitting models to data.

-   simulate observations of Y from a specified linear model

1.  to begin, we start with a collection of x values (we might imagine we measure these values in the wild)

```{r module00-lm-a-simple-linear-model-in-r-simulate}
n <- 100
X <- runif(n=100, min=0, max= 50)
head(X)
```

-   This code randomly chooses `n = 100` values uniformy at random from the interval $[0,50]$.

2.  Define the model

Next, we construct our simple linear model

```{r module00-lm-a-simple-linear-model-in-r-simulate-2}
alpha <- 4
beta <- 1.2
sigma <- 4

simple_linear_model <- function(X, alpha, beta, sigma) {
  mu <- alpha + (beta * X) 
  mu + rnorm(length(X), mean = 0, sd = sigma)
}
```

-   This is function takes x values and returns the specified linear function with normally distributed random noise added.

-   Now we can simulate observations of $Y$ given our list of $x$ values and out linear model:

```{r module00-lm-a-simple-linear-model-in-r}
Y <- simple_linear_model(X, alpha, beta, sigma)
head(Y)
```

lets look at the joint distribution of x and Y:
