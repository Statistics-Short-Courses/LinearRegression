# Building models by constructing terms

## Polynomials

### Key topics to emphasise

- Emphasise that polynomial terms model smooth curvature and require careful interpretation at different predictor levels.
- Demonstrate how polynomial degree affects model flexibility and risk of overfitting.
- Include a note on the bias–variance trade-off to frame how adding higher-degree terms can reduce bias but increase variance.
- Encourage plotting predicted values to visualise curvature.

### Potential examples

- Use a dataset with age vs. lung capacity to illustrate diminishing returns via quadratic terms.
- Contrast polynomial regression with piecewise linear fits to show alternative approaches.

### Potential exercises

- fit linear, quadratic, and cubic models and compare adjusted $R^2$ values.
- Provide predicted curves and have learners match them to the appropriate polynomial degree.

## Interactions

### Key topics to emphasise

- Interpret interaction coefficients as changes in slopes across levels of another predictor.
- Highlight the necessity of plotting interactions (e.g., interaction plots, marginal effects).
- Discuss the difference between interactions involving continuous vs. categorical variables.
- Note that interactions need not be simple products; they can combine predictors through indicator-triggered slopes, smooth-varying functions, or other structured contrasts.

### Potential examples

- Fit a model predicting salary from years of experience, gender, and their interaction to discuss equity analyses.
- Show how to compute and interpret simple slopes at specific predictor values.

### Potential exercises

- calculate predicted outcomes at combinations of predictor values to interpret interaction effects.
- choose between plots of an how an interaction would appear.
