# Expanding data by adding predictor variables

## Session overview

- Revisit the assumptions that underlie multiple linear regression and how they extend the simple linear case.
- Motivate the need for multiple predictors with short stories from real-world analyses (e.g., predicting house prices or patient outcomes).
- Highlight how model selection, diagnostics, and interpretation change as models become more complex.
- Encourage learners to connect ideas across chapters by comparing model summaries, visual diagnostics, and inferential statements.

### Potential exercises

- Ask learners to brainstorm scenarios where a single predictor is insufficient and list potential additional variables.
- Provide a model summary output and have learners identify which regression assumptions they would check first.

## Quantitative predictors

### Key topics to emphasise

- Clarify the meaning of partial regression coefficients as “holding other variables constant.”
- Discuss the role of centred and standardised predictors for interpretability and numerical stability.
- Use added-variable plots or component-plus-residual plots to visualise the unique contribution of each predictor.

### Potential examples

- Fit a model predicting fuel efficiency (e.g., `mtcars` data) from engine size, weight, and horsepower to show competing effects.
- Contrast models with raw vs. centred predictors to illustrate interpretational differences.

### Potential exercises

- Provide learners with a dataset (such as `mtcars`) and have them interpret the coefficient of weight before and after centring.
- Ask learners to build a scatterplot matrix to hypothesise relationships among continuous predictors before modelling.

### Multi-collinearity

#### Key topics to emphasise

- Define variance inflation factors (VIFs) and tolerance as diagnostic tools.
- Explain why multicollinearity inflates standard errors and complicates inference.
- Highlight remedial strategies: collecting more data, combining variables, or using regularisation methods.

#### Potential examples

- Demonstrate high correlation between horsepower and displacement in the `mtcars` dataset and show the impact on coefficient estimates.
- Compare model outputs before and after removing a redundant predictor.

#### Potential exercises

- Provide correlation matrices and ask learners to flag problematic pairs of predictors.
- Have learners compute VIFs for a fitted model and interpret which predictors require attention.

## Qualitative predictors

### Key topics to emphasise

- Review dummy (indicator) coding and how the choice of reference category affects interpretation.
- Explain how to include categorical predictors with more than two levels using treatment or sum coding.
- Introduce the concept of adjusted means when controlling for other predictors.

### Potential examples

- Model exam scores using study hours (continuous) and teaching method (categorical) to illustrate contrasts.
- Show how to interpret coefficients when switching the reference category.

### Potential exercises

- Ask learners to encode a three-level categorical variable manually and verify with software output.
- Provide regression results and have learners translate coefficients into comparisons between categories.
