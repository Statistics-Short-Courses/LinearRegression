# Course Overview {#sec-course-overview .unnumbered}

Linear regression is one of the most widely used tools in data analysis. It helps us describe and predict an outcome $Y$ using one or more predictors $X$, while also quantifying how uncertain our conclusions are.

This short course focuses on **practical regression workflows**:

1. **Specify** a sensible model for your question,
2. **Fit and interpret** it in R,
3. **Diagnose** whether the model is misleading,
4. **Remedy** common problems (or revise the model), and
5. **Communicate** what the model does—and does not—support.

Regression is not just “fit a line”: it is a cycle of modelling, checking, and improving.

## What you will learn {#sec-what-you-will-learn}

- Turn real questions into simple and multiple linear regression models (and state the assumptions clearly).
- Interpret regression output: coefficients, partial effects, interactions, and categorical predictors.
- Quantify uncertainty using standard errors, confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and hypothesis tests.
- Compare and refine models using fit metrics (including $R^2$ / adjusted $R^2$) and information criteria (AIC/BIC).
- Detect common pitfalls: nonlinearity, heteroskedasticity, non-normal errors, dependence, multicollinearity, outliers, leverage, and influential observations.
- Apply practical remedies: transformations, adding appropriate terms, revising variables, and using robust approaches when needed.

## Course roadmap {#sec-course-roadmap}

These chapters are designed to build from foundations → modelling → diagnostics → an end-to-end case study.

- **Chapter 00 — Introduction to linear models:** what a regression model is, why we need an error term, and what assumptions mean in practice.
- **Chapter 01 — Simple linear regression (SLR):** least squares, fitted values and residuals, inference, and prediction.
- **Chapter 02 — Multiple linear regression (MLR):** partial regression coefficients, adjustment, categorical predictors, and overall model tests.
- **Chapter 03 — Model building:** interactions, polynomial terms, parsimony, and model comparison/selection (with caveats).
- **Chapter 04 — Regression pitfalls & diagnostics:** how to recognise assumption violations and influence, and what to do about them.
- **Chapter 05 — Case study (NAPLAN):** a guided workflow from question → model → diagnostics → interpretation.
- **Glossary:** short definitions plus formulas and useful R functions.

## How to use this book {#sec-how-to-use-this-book}

- **Read sequentially** if you are new to regression; jump to Chapter 04 if you mainly need a diagnostics “field guide”.
- **Run the examples** as you go. Most examples are written to run in-browser using WebR; you can also run them in R/RStudio.
- **Hover or click glossary terms**: glossary links include short tooltips and take you to a full entry with formulas and relevant R functions.
- **Treat diagnostics as part of the analysis**: when a plot or check suggests a problem, the chapter aims to show a reasonable next step rather than a one-size-fits-all rule.
