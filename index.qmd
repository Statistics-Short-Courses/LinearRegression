# Course Overview {#sec-course-overview .unnumbered}


## What you will learn {#sec-what-you-will-learn}

- Formulate simple and multiple linear regression models and articulate
  their assumptions.
- Interpret regression coefficients, including partial, interaction, and
  categorical effects.
- Evaluate model utility using hypothesis tests, R-squared metrics, and
  prediction accuracy.
- Identify when additive models fail and implement interaction or
  polynomial terms.
- Incorporate qualitative predictors using indicator (dummy) variables.
- Apply principles of parsimony and evidence-based model building.
- Use AIC, multicollinearity diagnostics, and stepwise procedures for
  model selection.
- Perform residual analysis, identify influential observations, and
  apply transformations.

## How to use this book {#sec-how-to-use-this-book}

- Each chapter corresponds to a module in the syllabus and ends with
  short practice prompts.
- R examples use base `lm()` and standard diagnostics; you can run code
  chunks directly if you enable execution.
- The *Assessments* chapter outlines optional exercises and a capstone
  project that integrate exploration, model selection, and diagnostics.
