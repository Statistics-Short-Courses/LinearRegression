## Andy's notes
- Too much maths at the start "thown in quickly" introduced terms (function) (betas)
    - Glossary could be very helpful here (e.g. introduce in intro recommed, keeping open)
    -excersse 1.2 on using parameter variables needs clarification (e.g. specify that we ant to use the defined variables rather than the raw values)
    -perhaps reassure that its ok to not completely understand the conceptual stuff at first, and were going to work through an example that should be straightforward. 
    - R outputting vector for input vector was slightly confusing.
-example salary should have different E[Y]'s e.g. use 5 years

Example 2:
- commas in numbers vs separating parameters in normal dist( e.g. N(70,000,4,000^2)) confusing. 
- Squaring of SD term unclear (probability background) - MAke a glossary term for sd(sigma symbol) which reminds of it's relation to variance. 

-Normal prob calculator (reference to 'k' confusing) - remove?
