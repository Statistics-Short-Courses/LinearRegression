  - term: Statistical model
    definition: |
      A probabilistic description of how a response relates to predictors, combining a systematic component with random error.
  - term: Response (outcome) variable
    definition: |
      The variable $Y$ we aim to explain or predict.
  - term: Predictor (explanatory) variable
    definition: |
      A variable $x$ used to explain or predict changes in the response.
  - term: Linear predictor
    definition: |
      The deterministic part of a linear model, e.g. $E[Y|X] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k$.
  - term: Intercept
    definition: |
      The expected response when all predictors are zero; a baseline level.
  - term: Slope
    definition: |
      The expected change in the response per one-unit increase in a predictor, holding other predictors constant.
  - term: Random error term
    definition: |
      The stochastic component $\varepsilon$ that captures unexplained variation around the linear predictor.
  - term: Mean-zero errors
    definition: |
      The assumption $E[\varepsilon] = 0$, so predictions are correct on average.
  - term: Homoscedasticity
    definition: |
      Constant error variance across predictor values: $Var(\varepsilon)=\sigma^2$.
  - term: Normal errors
    definition: |
      The assumption $\varepsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$, supporting t- and F-based inference.
  - term: Independence
    definition: |
      Errors from different observations are independent of one another.
  - term: Ordinary least squares
    definition: |
      Estimation method that chooses coefficients to minimise the sum of squared residuals.
    aliases:
      - OLS
  - term: Sum of squared residuals
    definition: |
      $\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2$, the total squared discrepancy between observed and fitted values.
    aliases:
      - SSR
      - RSS
  - term: Mean squared error
    definition: |
      The sum of squared residuals divided by its degrees of freedom; an estimator of $\sigma^2$.
    aliases:
      - MSE
  - term: Degrees of freedom
    definition: |
      The number of independent pieces of information after estimating parameters (e.g., $n-2$ in SLR).
  - term: Standard error
    definition: |
      The estimated standard deviation of a coefficient estimate; quantifies uncertainty.
  - term: t-test
    definition: |
      Tests whether a coefficient differs from zero using a t statistic and the assumed error distribution.
  - term: p-value
    definition: |
      The probability, under the null, of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed.
  - term: Confidence interval
    definition: |
      A range of plausible parameter values at a chosen confidence level (e.g., 95%).
  - term: Prediction interval
    definition: |
      An interval for a future observation at given predictors; wider than a confidence interval.
  - term: F-test (overall model test)
    definition: |
      Tests whether at least one predictor has a nonzero coefficient compared with an intercept-only model.
  - term: Partial regression coefficient
    definition: |
      The effect of $x_i$ on $E[Y]$ holding all other predictors constant.
  - term: Polynomial term
    definition: |
      A predictor raised to a power (e.g., $x^2$, $x^3$) to model curvature while staying linear in parameters.
  - term: Overfitting
    definition: |
      When a model captures noise in the training data and generalises poorly to new data.
  - term: Stepwise regression
    definition: |
      An automated selection approach that adds/removes predictors based on a criterion (e.g., AIC or adjusted $R^2$).
  - term: Heteroskedasticity
    definition: |
      Nonconstant error variance across predictor values (the opposite of homoscedasticity).
  - term: Standardized residual
    definition: |
      A residual scaled by its estimated standard deviation to highlight unusually large deviations.
  - term: Outlier
    definition: |
      An observation with an unusually large residual relative to the fitted model.
  - term: Influential point
    definition: |
      An observation that substantially changes fitted coefficients or predictions when removed.
  - term: Extrapolation
    definition: |
      Making predictions outside the observed predictor range, where model assumptions may fail.
  - term: Simple linear regression
    definition: |
      A linear model with one predictor: $E[Y] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ with independent, mean-zero errors.
  - term: Multiple linear regression
    definition: |
      A linear model with two or more predictors; each coefficient is a partial effect holding the others fixed.
  - term: Residual
    definition: |
      An observed value minus its fitted value from the model: $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$.
  - term: Residual standard error
    definition: |
      The estimated standard deviation of the residuals (square root of the residual variance).
  - term: Pearson correlation
    definition: |
      Measures linear association between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1.
  - term: R-squared
    definition: |
      The proportion of variance in $Y$ explained by the model: $R^2 = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}}$.
  - term: Adjusted R-squared
    definition: |
      $R^2$ penalised for the number of predictors to discourage unnecessary terms.
  - term: Akaike Information Criterion
    definition: |
      Model comparison metric that balances fit and complexity; lower values indicate a preferred model among those compared.
    aliases:
      - AIC
  - term: Bayesian Information Criterion
    definition: |
      Model comparison metric that penalises complexity more than AIC; lower values indicate a preferred model among those compared.
    aliases:
      - BIC
  - term: Multicollinearity
    definition: |
      Strong correlation among predictors that inflates standard errors and destabilises estimates.
  - term: Interaction
    definition: |
      A term that allows the effect of one predictor to depend on the level of another (e.g., $X_1 X_2$).
  - term: Dummy variable
    definition: |
      An indicator (0/1) used to code categories in regression relative to a baseline.
  - term: Leverage
    definition: |
      A measure of how far a case's predictor values are from the predictor means; high leverage can increase influence.
  - term: Cook's distance
    definition: |
      Influence measure combining residual size and leverage to flag points that change fitted values when omitted.
  - term: Box-Cox transformation
    definition: |
      A family of power transformations used to stabilise variance or improve linearity for positive responses.
  - term: Parsimony
    definition: |
      Choosing the simplest adequate model that answers the scientific question.
